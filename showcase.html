The challenge was to create a bigger affection between the direction and the employees. We figured that proper use of the word ‘team’ should do the trick. That includes a team page, social section and the option to share your music experiences.</p>

I wanted to turn their online shop into a web application, so people can order their lunch on the go and then pick it up within a short while.</p>
